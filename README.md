## Completed Tasks

### 1. Web Development
- **Main Interface (`index.html`)**: Built a sleek, single-page layout featuring a dynamic greeting, current time display, and professional sections (About, Skills, Projects).
- **Styling (`style.css`)**: Implemented a "Glassmorphism" design system using CSS variables, smooth gradients, and micro-animations for a premium look and feel.
- **Dynamic Features**: Added JavaScript to handle real-time clock updates and responsive interactions.

### 2. Git & GitHub Integration
- **Local Initialization**: Initialized a new Git repository for the personal page.
- **Privacy Protection**: Configured Git identity to match the current user.
- **Successful Deployment**: Pushed the entire codebase to the remote repository: [https://github.com/Steward-creat/personal-web-page.git](https://github.com/Steward-creat/personal-web-page.git).

## File Structure
